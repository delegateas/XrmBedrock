# üö® CRITICAL: Read AI Rules First

**BEFORE making ANY code changes, you MUST read and follow the rules in the `.ai_rules` folder.**

## Essential Rule Files

**‚ö†Ô∏è MANDATORY READING**: These files contain critical development patterns and standards:

1. **START HERE**: [.ai_rules/main.md](../.ai_rules/main.md) - Core development strategy and architecture overview
2. **Backend**: [.ai_rules/backend/backend.md](../.ai_rules/backend/backend.md) - C# coding standards and patterns  
3. **Azure**: [.ai_rules/backend/azure.md](../.ai_rules/backend/azure.md) - Functions and API development
4. **Dataverse**: [.ai_rules/backend/dao.md](../.ai_rules/backend/dao.md) - Data access patterns
5. **Plugins**: [.ai_rules/backend/plugin.md](../.ai_rules/backend/plugin.md) - Plugin development rules
6. **Frontend**: [.ai_rules/frontend/frontend.md](../.ai_rules/frontend/frontend.md) - JavaScript/TypeScript rules
7. **Testing**: [.ai_rules/test/integrationtest.md](../.ai_rules/test/integrationtest.md) - Test requirements

## Build & Test Commands

```bash
# Build solution (REQUIRED before submitting)
dotnet build --configuration Release

# Run tests (REQUIRED after any changes)
dotnet test --configuration Release
```

## Key Architectural Patterns

- **Error Handling**: Use OneOf pattern (`OneOf<TSuccess, TError>`)
- **Naming**: Follow established domain/area patterns (e.g., CustomerArea, ConfigurationArea)
- **Data Access**: Use DAO patterns defined in SharedContext
- **Testing**: Write integration tests for all new functionality

## Critical Reminders

- **Rule violations** = code gets reverted
- **Missing build/test** = changes get rejected  
- Follow established patterns in each domain/area
- Never skip the build/test validation

**‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING**: Code that doesn't follow these rules gets reverted. The rules contain critical architectural decisions, naming conventions, and patterns that ensure code quality and consistency across the entire solution.

**Read the rules. Follow the rules. Test your changes.**
