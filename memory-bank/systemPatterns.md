# System Patterns

## System Architecture
The repository is organized to support modular, cross-platform development for Microsoft Dataverse and Azure. The architecture separates concerns into distinct areas:
- **Azure Services**: Implemented as .NET (latest LTS) projects, deployed as Azure Functions or other services.
- **Dataverse Plugins**: Two plugin projectsâ€”one targeting .NET 4.6.2 for Dataverse deployment, and one targeting latest LTS .NET for testing.
- **Shared Projects**: Contain domain models, proxy classes, and business logic reused by both Azure and Dataverse components.
- **Web Resources**: TypeScript-only front-end logic for Dataverse forms and commands. All authored code must be TypeScript; only the generated JavaScript files are deployed to Dataverse.
- **Infrastructure**: Bicep templates for Azure resource provisioning.
- **Setup**: Scripts for one-time setup tasks (e.g., certificate generation).
- **Tools**: F# scripts for automation, code generation, and developer utilities.
- **Test**: Projects for integration and cross-platform business logic testing.

## Key Technical Decisions
- **Dataverse Schema Mapping**: The file `src/Shared/SharedContext/XrmContext.cs` contains a class for each Dataverse table, with an attribute for each column. This file serves as the canonical mapping between Dataverse tables/columns and C# code, making it the primary reference for understanding the data model in code.
- **TypeScript-Only Web Resources**: The src/Dataverse/WebResources project enforces a TypeScript-only policy. No authored JavaScript files are permitted; all source code must be TypeScript, and only the compiled JavaScript is deployed.
- **Trunk-Based Development**: All changes are integrated into a single main branch, with CI/CD pipelines for build, test, and deployment.
- **CI/CD Pipelines**: Defined in YAML under `.pipelines/`, with separate pipelines for build (pull requests) and build-and-deploy (trunk).
- **Infrastructure as Code**: Azure resources are provisioned using Bicep, ensuring reproducibility and version control.
- **Plugin Dual Targeting**: Plugins are compiled for both .NET 4.6.2 (Dataverse) and latest LTS .NET (testing), enabling robust test coverage.
- **Shared Logic**: Business logic is centralized in shared projects to avoid duplication and ensure consistency.
- **Testability**: Use of XrmMockup for in-memory Dataverse mocks and MessageExecutor for simulating Azure service interactions.

## Design Patterns in Use
- **Dependency Injection**: Used in Azure services and test harnesses to substitute dependencies (e.g., loggers, service mocks).
- **Separation of Concerns**: Clear boundaries between infrastructure, business logic, and integration code.
- **Mocking and Substitution**: For testing, dependencies are substituted or mocked as needed, supporting isolated and integration tests.
- **Code Generation**: F# scripts automate generation of context classes and domain models for Dataverse and TypeScript.

## Component Relationships
- **Azure and Dataverse**: Shared projects provide common logic and models, referenced by both Azure and Dataverse plugin projects.
- **Testing**: Test projects reference both Azure and Dataverse components, using mocks and message executors to simulate cross-platform flows.
- **Web Resources**: JavaScript code is deployed to Dataverse and interacts with plugin logic via Dataverse APIs.

## Critical Implementation Paths
- **Business Logic Flow**: Business logic is implemented in shared projects, invoked by both plugins (Dataverse) and Azure Functions.
- **Testing Cross-Platform Logic**: Tests use XrmMockup and MessageExecutor to simulate Dataverse and Azure interactions, ensuring correctness across boundaries.
- **Deployment**: CI/CD pipelines automate build, test, and deployment, with Bicep templates provisioning required Azure infrastructure.

## Extensibility
- New Azure services, plugins, or shared logic can be added by following the established project structure and referencing shared projects as needed.
- Additional F# scripts or setup scripts can be introduced for new automation or configuration requirements.

## Plugin Extensibility and Service Registration

To add new plugins and related business logic for Dataverse:

- **Plugin Class Location:**  
  Create a new class in `src/Dataverse/SharedPluginLogic/Plugins` inside a folder matching the relevant business area (e.g., `Warehousing`, `Economy`, etc.). If no folder exists for the area, create one. Each plugin class should represent a logical grouping of plugin steps for that area.

- **Registering Plugin Steps:**  
  In the plugin class constructor, use `RegisterPluginStep` calls to specify the Dataverse table, operation (e.g., Create, Update), and stage (e.g., PreOperation, PostOperation) for which the plugin should execute. Each step should call the appropriate service method for the business logic to be triggered.

- **Service Implementation and Exposure:**  
  Implement the business logic as services in `src/Dataverse/SharedPluginLogic/Logic` within a folder named for the same area. Any services that should be public for the area must be exposed via a static method in an `AddServices` class (e.g., `AddServices.cs`) within the area folder. This class is responsible for registering all services for dependency injection.

- **Service Registration:**  
  All area `AddServices` methods must be called from `src/Dataverse/SharedPluginLogic/Plugins/PluginSetupCustomDependencies.cs`. This ensures that all services are registered and available for plugin execution.

**Summary Flow:**
1. Add/organize plugin class in `Plugins/[Area]`
2. Register plugin steps in the constructor using `RegisterPluginStep`
3. Implement business logic in `Logic/[Area]`
4. Expose public services via static `Add[Area]` method
5. Register all area services in `PluginSetupCustomDependencies.cs`

This pattern ensures a modular, discoverable, and maintainable approach to plugin and service development in the project.
