# Progress

## What Works
- Memory bank documentation is established, providing a comprehensive foundation for project context and onboarding.
- Repository structure supports modular development for Dataverse and Azure integrations.
- CI/CD pipelines, infrastructure-as-code, and setup scripts are in place.
- Shared logic and testability patterns are implemented, enabling robust cross-platform testing.
- Current business logic files are samples/placeholders and not intended for production use.

## What's Left to Build
- Generate new proxy classes for your own Dataverse environment using the provided tooling.
- Write and implement your own business logic to replace the sample files.
- Expand documentation for complex features, integrations, and testing strategies as they are developed.
- Add new Azure services, plugins, or shared logic as project requirements evolve.
- Refine and update memory bank files after each significant change or milestone.

## Current Status
- Project is in a ready state for onboarding new developers and beginning feature development.
- All core architectural, technical, and process documentation is in place.

## Known Issues
- No major issues identified at this stage.
- Future issues and blockers should be documented here as they arise.

## Evolution of Project Decisions
- Initial focus on documentation and shared logic to reduce onboarding time and technical debt.
- Adoption of trunk-based development, automated CI/CD, and infrastructure-as-code for reliability and maintainability.
- Emphasis on testability and code reuse across Dataverse and Azure components.
